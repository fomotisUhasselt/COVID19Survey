This is a so-called radar plot or spider plot. <br><br>
 
The circular full black line represents the prevalence of symptoms that are linked to COVID-19, on March 24, which we denote as the reference date. The coloured polyhedrons display the evolution of each symptom per week, relative to March 24. Dots that lie within the circle indicate a proportional decrease in the symptom’s prevalence, while dots that lie on the outside of the circle pinpoint a proportional increase.

For your information: The outer dotted circle represents a proportional 50% increase of a symptom’s prevalence, while the inner dotter circle indicates a proportional 50% decrease, both relative to March 24. <br><br>
 
We observe that the majority of the symptoms has decreased proportionally, but not equally for each symptom. <br> 
Fever and chills have decreased strongly, while symptoms that are often linked with hay fever, such as sore eyes, a running nose, and shortness of breath, are still prevalent in the population.
