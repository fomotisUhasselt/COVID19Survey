We have asked participants twelve questions regarding their mental well-being. <br><br>

Based on these questions, we have computed the GHQ12 score, which represents, on a scale of 12 points, the mental health of a person (0: no complaints, 12: serious mental complaints).

These questions were previously asked in the Belgian Health questionnaire 2018 by Sciensano. At that time, the average Belgian had a score of 1.7 out of 12. <br><br>

You can choose the population group for which you want to see the results. <br>
We observe that the GHQ12-score has increased strongly during the corona epidemic. <br>
Especially children and adolescents (0-17 year) and women have lower scores than under normal circumstances. <br><br>

The 12 questions that were used to calculate the GHQ12 score, are: <br>

<ul>
<li>Have you been able to concentrate on your activities during the past week?</li>
<li>Have you experienced insomnia because of worrying during the last week?</li>
<li>Have you felt that you were spending your time meaningfully this past week?</li>
<li>Have you felt able to make decisions about things during the past week?</li>
<li>Have you felt under constant pressure during the past week?</li>
<li>Have you felt like you could not handle your problems during the last week?</li>
<li>Have you been able to enjoy your normal, everyday activities during the past week?</li>
<li>Have you been able to face your problems this past week?</li>
<li>Have you felt unhappy or depressed during the last week?</li>
<li>Have you lost faith in yourself during the last week?</li>
<li>Have you felt like a useless person during the last week?</li>
<li>Have you felt reasonably happy during the last week, all things considered?</li>
</ul>
