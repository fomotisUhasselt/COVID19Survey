This table displays the amount of relational tensions between age groups. <br><br>

Each box shows the proportion of the people in the age group on the vertical axis that report increased tensions with each age group on the horizontal axis. 
A darker red coloration indicates a higher proportion of participants reporting tensions.<br><br>

E.g., on April 14, 16.95% of all participants that are over 70 years old, report increased tensions with persons that are 0 to 17 years old. <br><br>

We have observed that especially children and young adults experience increased tensions with people from all other age groups. The opposite is shown as well: other age groups mostly report tensions with persons that are 0 to 17 years old.
