This bar chart shows the average number of people with whom participants have spoken outside of their households during the day before the survey. Only face-to-face conversations are included; no virtual conversations (phone calls, skype calles, etc.). <br><br>

The graph is categorised by province. Information for a specific demographic group can be obtained by changing the graph settings. <br><br>

Participants from Wallonia report fewer conversations on average. Due to the low participation rate in Wallonia, one should be cautious when interpreting these results, as it is possible that we mainly reach persons who closely follow the corona crisis and strictly adhere to the measures in low-response areas.
