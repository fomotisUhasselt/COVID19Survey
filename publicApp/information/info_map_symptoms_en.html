These maps show the percentage of the population in a certain municipality reporting at least one COVID-19 symptom (= self-reported symptom prevalence).
These percentages were obtained as predictions from a statistical model that accounts for the population structure in each municipality.<br><br>

The <strong>Timevarying legend</strong> is different for each round of the Corona Study and is mainly informative to pinpoint regions with an increased symptom prevalence within each survey round. <br><br>

The <strong>fixed legend</strong> remains constant over time and is mostly informative when you want to study the evolution of the symptom prevalence over multiple surveys.<br><br>

<i style='color:#f00' class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> &nbsp; Note that the flu season was nearing its end during the first rounds of the Corona Study. This complicates the correct interpretation of the evolution of the coronavirus prevalence from these graphs.
