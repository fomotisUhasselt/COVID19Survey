Bar charts indicate how participants have adjusted their behaviour at work, in public places, and within their households during the corona epidemic. <br><br>

You can choose the demographical group for which you want to display the results. <br><br>

We observe that all demographical groups have strongly adapted their behaviour in accordance of the measures. 
However, there are clear differences between age categories. 
Young children and adolescents (0-17 year) report the lowest adjustment rates of their own behaviour at public places, while we see that this category has the lowest number of contacts with people outside of their households. <br><br>

The reliability of these results depends on the sample sizes within specific population groups. For example, there is only a small number of participants younger than 18 years or older than 65 years, who have to arrange childcare for their family members.
