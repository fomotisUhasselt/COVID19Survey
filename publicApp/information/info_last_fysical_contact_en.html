We combine several studies to investigate when participants stopped having physical contacts outside of their households. <br><br>

The dotted lines indicate the dates when measures were taken by the government: <br>
<ul>
<li>March 11: measures regarding visits in nursing homes and limitations to crowd attendances at large events</li>
<li>March 13: school closure, non-essential shops have to close during the weekend</li>
<li>March 17: announcement lockdown light </li>
</ul>

Our study shows that the majority of the population has stopped having physical contacts outside of their households after the lockdown light measure had been taken.
Elderly (65+ year) started to avoid physical contacts considerably sooner than others. Many children stopped having physical contact when schools closed.<br><br>

These results also show that a small group, mostly consisting of children and adolescents (0-17 years), still has regular physical contacts outside of their households.
