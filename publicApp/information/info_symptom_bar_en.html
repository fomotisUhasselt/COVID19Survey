<h4>Symptoms tab</h4>
This bar chart shows the proportion of participants reporting a specific COVID-19 symptom.<br><br>

We observe a strong decrease of symptoms over time.<br>
During the last round (April 14) we have observed an increase in a number of symptoms that can be linked to hay fever (running nose, sore throat). <br><br>

<i style='color:#f00' class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> &nbsp; Note that the flu season was nearing its end during the first rounds of the Corona Study. This complicates the correct interpretation of the evolution of the coronavirus from these graphs.
