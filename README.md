## Steps

1.  Clone this repo by running `git clone
    https://github.com/fomotisUhasselt/COVID19Survey.git` in git bash or
    simply click on the `clone` option in the `Repository` tab, if you
    use Git GUI.

2.  Create your own branch within the repo by running `git checkout -b
    your_branch_name_here` in git bash.

3.  After every analysis:

<!-- end list -->

1.  add changes made to your branch by running `git add .`

2.  commit changes to your branch by running `git commit -m "a short
    descritptive message of what you did here"`

3.  push changes made to your branch by running `git push origin
    your_branch_name_here`

4.  create a pull request for your changes to be added to the master
    file by clicking on the `pull requests`, and `new pull request tab`
    tab on Github.

## Note

It is safer for each of us to create branches and work with our
individual branches. After finishing any analysis, you can create a pull
request for it to be merged with the master. Doing this allows easy
tracing of errors.
